    <h3>A Simple, Sweet, and Savory Treat</h3>
    <p><strong>Elote</strong> (pronounced eh-loh-tay) is Mexican street corn. A delicious, quick and easy meal that will leave you and whoever is eating wanting more. </p>
    <p>In Mexico, elote means an ear of corn, and this recipe replicates a popular serving style sold by street vendors. I can't claim that this elote recipe is quite authentic, but it brings me back to the elotes I enjoyed in Mexico.</p>
    <p>Elote is made with corn on the cob, slathered with mayonnaise, seasoned with chili powder, and sprinkled all over with salty Cotija cheese. It's messy to eat but worth every bite. Elote is the perfect summertime side dish for any Mexican-inspired meal</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>4 cobs of corn</li>
    <li>1/2 cup cotija cheese</li>
    <li>1/2 tbsp. chile powder</li>
    <li>1/4 cup mayonnaise</li>
    <li>4 pairs of corn holders/skewers</li>
</ul>
<ol>
    <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Shuck the corn, remove the silk and stalk. Add corn to water, cover and cook for 5 minutes, then remove.</li>
    <li>When corn is cool enough to touch but still warm, insert corn holders into both ends.</li>
    <li>Brush corn with 1 tablespoon of mayonnaise, sprinkle with 2 tablespoons cheese. Add chili powder to taste.</li>
    <li>Repeat with remaining ears of corn and serve.</li>
</ol>
